MinakiLabs-IX: A Community-Driven Micro-IXP
MinakiLabs-IX is an open-source project aimed at building a decentralized and experimental Internet Exchange Point (IXP). Our mission is to create a collaborative platform where ISPs, network engineers, and hobbyists can work together to develop a neutral and accessible IXP that grows through community involvement.
This repository contains the core infrastructure, tools, and scripts needed to get MinakiLabs-IX up and running, including:
Colocation and Peering Documentation: Learn how to connect to our IXP and contribute to its development.
Automation Tools: Scripts and configurations for setting up, managing, and automating the exchange.
Relay System (In Development): Future plans to enable remote connection for peers to drop lines into our infrastructure.
Community Contributions: We welcome pull requests, issues, and feedback as we continue to build this platform together.
We’re still in the early stages, so we need the help of the community to refine and expand this project. Whether you’re an expert in networking or just curious, your input can help shape the future of decentralized internet exchange.
